This is a LED light bar intended as an overhead light for a pool table, using
a hood. A hood can be 3D printed from the file here:

\includegraphics[height=1in]{hood\_qr\_download.png}.

The light bar can also be used anywhere a linear 6 foot florescent or LED light
fixture might be used. The light bar has 3 white SMD LEDs with a series
resistor and is intended for a 12V supply. Can be driven from a MCU with a
driver using PWM to adjust brightness. 

\section{Connecting the board}

The board has two (2) through hole solder pads. They are labeled with plus (+) 
and minus (-) signs.  Typically wires can be fed from the back side of the 
board and soldered on the front side.  These wires can be used to suspend the 
board from a ceiling.

This is a LED light bar intended as an overhead light for a bar, but can be
used anywhere for building interrier lighting is desired. It is 304.50000 H0
scale inches or 25.37500 H0 scale feet long. It can be mounted on the ceiling
of a building to provide a strip of lighting. It has 3 white SMD LEDs with a
series resistor and is intended for a 12V supply. Can be driven from a MCU
with a driver using PWM to adjust brightness.

\section{Connecting the board}

The board has two (2) through hole solder pads. They are labeled with plus (+) 
and minus (-) signs.  Typically wires can be fed from the back side of the 
board and soldered on the front side.

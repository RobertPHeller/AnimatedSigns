This is a printed circuit board containing SMD LEDs meant to replace the
static sign in the Perplexing Puzzles Plus HO Scale Roadside Motel (Bates
Motel) Kit\footnote{Available on E-Bay at
\url{https://www.ebay.com/itm/254591118293}.}. This PCB has three sets of LEDs
to light up three separate sections of the sign, the main name part (''Bates
Motel''), the word ``No'' and the word ``Vacancy'', on both sides of the sign.
It is a common cathode and includes resistors for 12VDC operation, either
staticly or with some sort of lighting effects electronics.

There are four solder pads at the bottom of the support posts, labeled: C
(common, +), V (''Vacency'', -), M (Main: ``Bates Motel'', -), and N (''No'',
-).
